# ngx-markdown

Custom version of [ngx-markdown](https://github.com/jfcere/ngx-markdown) with extra-features.

## Why ?

Because I have a necessity for [this feature](https://github.com/jfcere/ngx-markdown/pull/274) and the author didn't merge that yet.

## Note

Maybe in ther future, after that feature already added, this repository will be deleted.
